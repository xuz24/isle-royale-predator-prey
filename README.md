# isle-royale-predator-prey
Modified DataSci101 final project exploring the wolf-moose population relationship on Isle Royale.

Used Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn to analyze data.

Performed regression modeling, confidence interval tests, hypothesis tests, and exploratory data analysis.

Note: prediction accuracy was not a goal in this project. Instead this project is a showcase of the material learned in the class.
